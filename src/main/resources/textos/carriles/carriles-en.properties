topResumen = The top lane is usually home to tanky or bruiser champions with high durability and sustained damage. These champions typically play solo, focusing on winning their lane, applying side lane pressure, and becoming a constant one-on-one threat. In teamfights, they often act as initiators or soak up damage due to their resilience.

junglaResumen = The jungler moves through the jungle camps, defeating neutral monsters and assisting allies with ganks in various lanes. This role is crucial for map control, securing objectives like the Dragon and Rift Herald, and balancing out losing lanes. Strategic vision and map awareness are essential for a good jungler.

midResumen = The mid lane is commonly occupied by mages or assassins capable of dealing burst damage. This position is vital due to its central location, allowing quick rotations to other lanes and significant influence on the overall game flow. Mid laners often shine in teamfights thanks to their high damage output and crowd control.

adcResumen = The ADC (Attack Damage Carry) plays in the bottom lane alongside the support. Their main role is to deal consistent physical damage during fights. Although they are typically fragile, they are essential in the mid-to-late game due to their ability to eliminate targets quickly if well-positioned and protected.

suppResumen = The support acts as the team's guardian. They play in the bottom lane with the ADC and are responsible for protecting their carry, providing vision through wards, controlling enemies, and assisting in fights with utility skills. Depending on the type of support, they may heal, initiate fights, or shield and control the battlefield.
